# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The script (run_analysis.R) does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Write the clean dataset to disk.

Here are the data for the project:
